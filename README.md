### **HOMELESSNESS AND LIVING CONDITION**  

**OVERVIEW:** 
1.Economic Factors: Unemployment, low wages, and rising costs of living can lead to homelessness.

7.Encampments: Informal settlements, or tent cities, are created by homeless communities. While they offer some protection and community, they often lack basic amenities.

**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra‚Äôs,Max flow, Greedy , Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:** 
1.Health: Poor physical and mental health, higher mortality rates.
2.Safety: Increased risk of violence and exploitation.Education: Disruption in schooling, affecting future opportunities.
3.Development: Emotional and cognitive challenges in children.
4.Public Health: Spread of diseases due to poor living conditions.
5.Social Issues: Increased crime perception, social tension, and community strain.
